	<p><i>The following is a write-up of research done in the summer of 2021. </i></p>
	<p> The domains of philosophy are easy to classify - they are Logic, Aesthetics, Epistemology, Ethics and Metaphysics. Would the best map of human knowledge - Wikipedia - match this? </p>
	<p> By data scraping ~95% of Wikipedia article titles and links using the Python packages Requests and Beautiful Soup, and then plotting in Graphia as a spanning tree, I instead found the largest nodes to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" target="_blank"><i>Latin</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History" target="_blank"><i>History</i></a> (besides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy" target="_blank">the known central node</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy" target="_blank"><i>Philosophy</i>.</a>) To be honest, I was expecting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" target="_blank"><i>Science</i></a> to be the most connected.<p>

	<p> Is the future of VR inherently malicious? As it is, the largest userbase is in Japan where it is generally regarded as a form of escapism. Its development has mirrored previous techonology such as the iPhone (beat saber = tap tap revenge) which settled
 on addictive, socially-charged content consumption. We can expect, then, instagram, celebrity and twitch analogues to grow in the future; We already can capture 3D content using just a phone camera. </p>
<p> The current issue with VR is a lack of content. This is alarming because it means that easy-to-make addictive ideas will proliferate. And this is what we see - video games, poker and gimicks; the type that remind me of virtual flash game advertisements on the side of your browser 10 years ago. Useful software came naturally out of the invention of the computer - the only promise of VR is existential.</p>
<p> It is my belief, then, that the best VR ideas will be location-based exploration. To my knowledge, this has not been explored systematically, and the next best thing - YouTube - is not updated enough to keep up with hardware advancements. As it is, the quality of VR YouTube videos is roughly a quarter what it should be. Is this the case because VR has already passed its ethical inflection point? Probably not, but its beginning sure is a lot closer to the iPhone than the Mac.</p>

	<p> Experimented with upscaling the textures to SSX On Tour using ESRGAN. Results are impressive but not good for this title because of tiling (and thus manual work). See it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjbmQisw_g" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
